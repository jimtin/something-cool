# Build Your Own Trading Bot
Building your own trading bot can be a ton of fun - but also pretty intimidating to get started! 

This repo is a companion to my blog series on how to [Build Your Own Trading Bot](https://tradeoxy.com/blog/), part of [TradeOxy](https://tradeoxy.com/).

## Setting You Up for (Building) Success
