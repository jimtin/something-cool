# Build Your Own Trading Bot
Building your own trading bot can be a ton of fun - but also pretty intimidating to get started! 

This repo is a companion to my blog series on how to [Build Your Own Trading Bot](https://tradeoxy.com/blog/), part of [TradeOxy](https://tradeoxy.com/).

## Setting You Up for (Building) Success
TradeOxy's mission is to **Democratize Algorithmic Trdaing**. It's been that way since we first started in [buildspace S4 Nights and Weekends](https://buildspace.so/nights-weekends). We feel that this repo, in companionship with your blog series, gives you the best chance at building your own successful trading algorithms. 

We also know that in real life sometimes you just need some live support! If you've got some questions about the blog, YouTube channel, or the code in this repo, you can reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1143837842745864192/1143837843274342432).
